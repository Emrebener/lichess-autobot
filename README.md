A desktop application that plays chess on Lichess using the Board API. This bot is designed for testing and understanding the Lichess Board API, particularly useful for physical chess board development.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This application uses the **Board API**, which is intended for physical chess boards and third-party clients. Engine assistance is **forbidden** on regular Lichess accounts when using the Board API. This tool is for educational and development purposes only.

If you want to run an engine-assisted bot legally on Lichess, you need to:

1. Create a fresh account (no games played)
2. Upgrade it to a Bot account using the Bot API
3. Use the Bot API endpoints instead

## Troubleshooting

### "No engines found"

- Make sure you've placed UCI engine executables in the `engines/` folder
- On Windows, engines should be `.exe` files (e.g., `stockfish.exe`)
- Click the "🔄" refresh button to rescan
- Check that engine files have execute permissions

### Token validation fails

- Ensure your token has the required scopes (`board:play`, `challenge:read`, `challenge:write`)
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Verify your internet connection
- Try generating a new token from Lichess settings

### Game doesn't start

- Board API only allows Rapid, Classical, and Correspondence time controls
- Make sure you're not already in a game
- Check the status bar (bottom-left) for error messages
- Verify your token is validated (green checkmark)

### Evaluation not working

- Check that "Real-time Evaluation" toggle is ON in Preferences
- Verify an evaluation engine is selected in the dropdown
- Some engines require network files (e.g., Leela needs .pb weights)
- Check the evaluation bar is visible (shows when toggle is enabled)

### Engine errors

- Verify the engine is a valid UCI engine
- Try running the engine manually from command line to check for errors
- For Stockfish: Ensure you have the correct binary for your system
- For Leela (lc0): Make sure network weights file is in the same folder
- For Maia: Enable "Single node?" checkbox
- Check UCI options (⚙️ button) for engine-specific settings

### Board orientation wrong

- The bottom-left square should be dark (a1)
- Board automatically flips when playing as black
- If issues persist, check you're running the latest version

### Performance issues

- Reduce engine threads in UCI Options
- Lower hash table size for evaluation engine
- Disable real-time evaluation if not needed
- Close other resource-intensive applications
